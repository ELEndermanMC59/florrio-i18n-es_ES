	- Poison from different players against the same mob now stack.

	- Higher tier mobs now have varying amounts of slow resistance.

30 de Diciembre de 2022

	- We're experimenting with a HUGE rebalancing of the entire game. We've reset everyone's waves for this. Please be patient while we tweak things to get everything perfect.
	- The idea is increasing the gap between rarities. Such that if you have unusual petals, a rare mob actually presents a bigger challenge. Before this update, there wasn't really enough distinction between lower mob rarities.

	- As a reminder, we'll be adding more things to spend TP on as time goes on.

29 de Noviembre de 2022
	- The long awaited talents update is here.

15 de Noviembre de 2022
	- Nerfed Hornet health.

6 de Noviembre de 2022
	- Tweaked number of mobs in each wave.
	- Tweaked map size in later waves.

	- We've reset the highest wave beaten by everyone to wave 25, if it was previously higher than that. This is due to the change in wave difficulty.
	- Enemies no longer have their attack range the same as their aggro range (so hornets for example won't start attacking from half way across the map).

4 de Noviembre de 2022

	- Recipe for Ultra petals has changed.

	  Now creates 3 Ultras from 1 Mythic.
	  No longer reverts back to Mythic on use, it's just lost forever.
	  Unused Ultras before this update have been converted back to 2 Mythics (old recipe).

2 de Noviembre de 2022
	- Added Ultra petals.
	  You can combine 2 Mythics to form an Ultra.
	  Ultra petals are several times stronger than Mythics, but only last for one match.
	  After one match, they will revert back to 1 Mythic (the other is lost).

20 de Octubre de 2022
	- Pseudo-RNG system has been removed from crafting. Now it's back to truly random with no increasing odds. If you have any failed attempts on a specific petal, it'll keep using the old system until you succeed (so you don't lose increased odds you already accumulated).

11 de Octubre de 2022
	- Added Apple ID login. Note that it doesn't merge Apple ID accounts with Discord accounts. If you already logged in using Discord, keep using that to login. This addition is intended to make it easier for those that don't have a Discord account to keep their progress.
